# Adding Beneficiary Design - Proposal 1

![preview](https://i.imgur.com/rsFZfI8.png)

User can enter the data into inputs inside of the cardView and then add a new beneficiary by tapping on submit button.

## Select Account Type

Select account type is nothing but select dropdown list, so on tap it will expand and collapse on item selected.

## Design Flow

### Inputs

Every input has underline, which changes its color whenever user has focus on input. (2nd screen - Office name)

If no data entered the hint is displayed (1st/2nd screen - Account number).

If input contains data, the header should appear above the input. 
Header has the same text as a hint. (2nd screen - Office name, Transfer limit, Beneficiary name).

#### On input focus

Keyboard appears, underline, header and text cursor change its color to the primary blue.

### Readability

Currently focused input changes its position to make it easier for the user to read it.

#### Input error

Should look exactly like the error on the 1st screen.

##### Red

These elements change its color to red:

* header
* error message beneath the underline
* underline

##### Normal (Black 86% transparency)

Text inside of incorrect input doesn't change the color.
