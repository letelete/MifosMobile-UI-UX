Just like on the first screen (Dashboard / All Cards Collapsed) presented on preview image above.

## Expand/Collapse Buttons
User can expand the data he's interested in by pressing on 'SHOW MORE' button.
Button text should change to 'SHOW LESS' then.
User can also collapse the expanded data by pressing on the same button with name 'SHOW LESS'.
On data collapsed, button text should change back to the 'SHOW MORE'.

On expanding, the data card below should change its position (Slide down to fit the margin size of expanded card above).

For example: User expands the first data card (Saving Accounts), Two cards below should slide down.
