## Action buttons

Action buttons design is similiar to the home_activity's buttons.
We've got some grid made of buttons where the add button has a different color to make the layout more dynamic.
The add button's color is as same as the `Charges` button in a `Home Activity`.

All buttons should have a ripple effect on click.

## Positioning

I've moved action buttons to the top to avoid some blank space between UI elements, but these are still in the green thumb zone :)
