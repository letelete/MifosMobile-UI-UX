## Design flow description

Under this title, I'll describe `Accounts / Share Tab` presented on image preview above.

### Checking account details

Starting from SHARE tab, user can easily check his specific account details by clicking on any of listed card views.

### Status

Status icons have its own description to make it easier for user understand what these catchy colors means.
I've added some simple hint for account number to improve user experience. Seeing these titles which were containing only numbers, could make user feel a little confused. Now he'll instantly know what are these about.

## Share account detail

Under this title, I'll describe `Accounts / Active` and `Accounts / Submitted And Pending Approval` presented on image preview above.

### Timeline

Share account detail will starts with a timeline to attract users attention. He can find every important detail on a cardview and also update / creation date on timeline's left.

### Account Details

User can find product name, status and currency details here.

### Shares Details

Shares details looks almost the same as user account dashboard elements. It's mainly because of its similiar topic. User can find here shares details including accounts ammount, number of approval pending and currently approved accounts.
